Description: Hi-C dataset processing algorithm introduced by Chao He (2016) <doi.org/10.1101/083576>.
   The optimized and flexible pipeline for analyzing the
   folding of whole chromosome and interactions between some
   specific sites from the Hi-C raw sequencing reads to the
   partially processed datasets. The other complex genetic and
   epigenetic datasets from public sources such as GWAS, ENCODE
   consortiums etc. will also easily be integrated into HBP,
   hence the final output results of HBP could provide a
   comprehensive in-depth understanding for the specific
   chromatin interactions, potential molecular mechanisms and
   biological significance. We believe that HBP is a reliable
   tool for the rapidly analysis of Hi-C data and will be very
   useful for a wide range of researchers, particularly those
   who lack of background in computational biology.
